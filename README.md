# Digital-security-in-company¬¥s
About this proyect is about the cybersecurity in company¬¥s, how ciberatacks be a problem a how we can avoid them.
 Just as the subtitle says, we will cover these topics, like hacking examples in Costa Rica, general problems for safe datas and the use about software or malware
The objetives about this proyect is make a awarness for protec the data for our company¬¥s and the people be more interested in this tipe of things.

# Now we can continue in this invetigation.
According to the original research, the main question is the following: ¬øwhat is the benefit of having updated and protected equipment for the proper functioning of the company?
Analyzing the data personally and also based on investigations, the most common thing for this response is to hire specialized personnel in the protection of this information and constantly review if it is in dangerüëæ.
But, I decided to look for a different answer than the current one and learn about other aspects, that's where thanks to a cybersecurity manager (who will remain anonymous out of respect for data privacy) from a local clinic who helped me collect different data. And more interesting, given this, I asked him the main question where he answered the following: "It is no secret to anyone that the globalization of communications, so it is possible to find large corporate networks that are part of the Internet or the dark net or deep web,(meaning databases that are not visible through traditional browsers and other type of somewhat obscure information), in addition to encountering people who take advantage of these communications to commit crimes, scamming or robbing unsuspecting people, or demanding money after a hack, as was the recent case of the CCSS and the Ministry of Finance. In order to minimize risks, one of the good practices is to have the computer equipment updated in two ways, one at the software level and the other at the hardware level.

Software Level:
All software is made by humans, therefore all software can be violated, the more known the software is, the more likely it is to be analyzed in order to find flaws and use these flaws to carry out attacks, for the above reasons and with the aim To maintain business prestige, software production companies pay prizes to people not related to the company, when they find a fault, of course they also have their teams of specialists. Fault detections, also known as backdoors, generate what are known as patches, some in computer security (eliminate those detected faults), other patches help improve the performance of computers, servers, and communications equipment.Because software production is a trade, software production companies.They also present new versions, leaving previous versions obsolete and unsupported.Technically, known cases are the different versions of Windows (Windows 95, ME, Vista,XP, 7, 8, 8.1, 10, 11) versions lower than 10 are no longer supported so make use of them can pose a great risk, although also because they represent a very small segment of use, probably not of interest for attacksncurrent cybernetics. All of the above is valid for cell phones.

Hardware Level:
Companies must try to have their hardware updated in order to use the newer software, outdated hardware means that it can only be used unsupported software, software for which security patches will not be created.

Incident

CVE-2023-46604: Vulnerability in Apache ActiveMQ is being actively exploited

ID: m-u6q4sBkSnY7hhsg]fo |
Category: Potential cyber attack |
Type: IA-VI |
Risk level: Critical | Date
validation: 07-11-2023 |
Tags: Vulnerability Intelligence, Global
Summary
Impact: Remote code execution.
Apache released security patches to mitigate the CVE-2023-46604 vulnerability that is being actively exploited.This flaw affects ActiveMQ, a message broker that allows communication between clients and servers through protocols such as: AMQP, MQTT, OpenWire and STOMP; which is why it is used in multiple implementations.On the other hand, Rapid7 assures that the vulnerability has been exploited to spread the Hellokitty ransomware, however, the details are unknown, we will continue to follow up and complementary reports will be issued as soon as additional information is available.

Vulnerability details
‚Ä¢ CVE asoclado: CVE-2023-46604
Severity: Critical
Category (CWE): CWE-502
‚Ä¢ Execution vector: Remote

Description: Vulnerability due to the software performing the deserialization process without verifying the origin of the data received through the OpenWire protocol, which could allow an attacker to execute malicious code on the system.
‚ö´ Vulnerable technology:
‚Ä¢ ActiveMQ, versions: 5.8.0-5.15.15, 5.16.05.16.6, 5.17.05.17.5, 5.18.0 - 5.18.2
‚Ä¢ ActiveMQ Legacy OpenWire Module, versions: 5.8.0-5.15.15, 5.16.0 - 5.16.6, 5.17.0 - 5.17.5, 5.18.05.18.2
‚ö´ Manufacturer: Apache
‚Ä¢ PoC available: Yes
‚Ä¢ Exploit available: Yes
‚Ä¢ Active exploitation: Yes
‚Ä¢ Mitigation: Install security patch
‚Ä¢ Workaround: N/A
Affected assets
The vulnerable technology is not found in the provisioning file, however, it is commonly used to carry out the operation in organizations, so it could represent a risk.
If you have this technology, please update the provisioning file.
recommendations:
In order to mitigate the associated risks, the Deloitte Mexico cyber intelligence team recommends the following:
1. Install security patches and follow the mitigation guide issued by Apache as soon as possible.
2. Deploy indicators of compromise (IoCs) in security tools:
‚Ä¢ Host IoCs can be enabled in anti-malware tools, HIDS or endpoint solutions with centralized console management.
‚Ä¢ The network IoCs provided can be deployed in tools such as Firewall,IDS, Web content filtering, UTMs, network proxy.
Commitment Indicators

To view the compromise indicators, consult the file in DISP: "IoCs_CVE-2023- 46604 07.11.2023.xlsx", in addition, they will be shared through the MISP platform so that they can be consumed in an automated manner.
